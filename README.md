Created an E-commerce site using Django Framework. This is just the initial version having basic functionality like login, logout, register, viewing items, adding items to cart etc. I'm still working on this project and will soon update the favorite and like functionality along with other functionality like ordering item and tracking your package using Google Map API.. 

Requirements:

-> Python
-> Django Framework
-> Mysql client for Python
